MobileNetV2-SSD
===========================
This is a caffe implementation of MobileNet-SSD V2 detection network. It is refered to the model released by tensorflow api [https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md).

You can also refer to this model in the paper [Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks: Mobile Networks for Classification, Detection and Segment](128.84.21.199/abs/1801.04381), it is Mobilenet V2+SSDLite architecture.

All these file is create for pascal voc which has 21 classes(one is background), you can change it to suit your dataset.

To do
===========================
caffe model on pascal VOC will be released later.
